    <a href="https://hydrochain.vercel.app/" target="blank">HydroChain (FlowShare)</a>: HydroChain (FlowShare) is a digital platform tailored for the oil and gas industry that modernizes hydrocarbon allocation among joint venture partners by enhancing transparency, efficiency, and compliance. It enables real-time tracking of hydrocarbon volumes with immutable, blockchain-secured records, and automates reconciliation processesâ€”reducing time from days to minutesâ€”while supporting multi-partner collaboration through shared workflows. The platformâ€™s workflow begins with field operators entering daily production data such as volume, BS&W, temperature, and API gravity, followed by terminal operators logging final receipt details including environmental conditions; an intelligent allocation engine then applies industry-standard formulas to automatically calculate and distribute fair shares. With advanced analytics, comprehensive reporting, and full audit trails, HydroChain streamlines shared asset operations, minimizing disputes and improving trust across joint ventures.
